# World Governance Indicators
Here are the files for the "Developing Data Products" course project.

I used a dataset from the world bank called "World Governance Indicators", which according to this global organization "Aggregate and individual governance indicators for 215 countries and territories over the period 1996â€“2014, for six dimensions of governance."
